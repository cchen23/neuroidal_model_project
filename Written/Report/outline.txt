- Explain Valiant model
  - Overview of model
  - Connections to neuroscience ("grandmother" cells, biological constraints, associative memory (hippcampus sparsity? cortex catastrophic interference?)
    - With weak synapses (Valiant 2005, Neural Computation)
    - Comparison to actual neural data (ie plausible) (Valiant 2006, Biological Cybernetics)
  - Compare/contrast with current neural networks
  - Shown to solve certain algorithsm (see Circuits of the Mind book)
  - Specifics of LINK and JOIN algorithms (Papadimitriou & Vempala Appendix A)

- Explain Papadimitrou/Vempala PJOIN
  - why PJOIN needed, why PJOIN works

- Relate both models to literature in neuroscience

- simulate algorithm. with disjoint and overlapping frameworks.
- they work with disjoint framework. we try to extend to overlapping framework.
